        <p>This is the blog for Amateur Radio Operator K7JSX.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intending to keep it up to date with notable events and milestones with the secondary goal of cataloging projects and relevant information as I go.</p>
<h1 id="about-me">About Me<a href="#about-me" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I started my technology journey early on with hobby electronic component kits, modding consoles and building PCs in the late 90&rsquo;s and early 00&rsquo;s.
I&rsquo;ve been connected to the internet since the 56k era and still continue to enjoy computer networking.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve installed Gentoo on an OG Xbox. It was awesome.</p>
<p>It was through the lense of tinkering and the desire to learn that I discovered amateur radio&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="ham-journey">Ham Journey<a href="#ham-journey" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Seeing SOTA operators such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@goathiker/videos">wGØAT</a> and others on Youtube bring voices (or cw) out of the atmosphere was fascinating.
How was this possible? Could I learn to do this? Of course!</p>
<p>This gave me a goal: <em>Learn how to do this well.</em></p>
<h3 id="technician">Technician<a href="#technician" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I earned my Technician license <code>2012.11.14</code> with the callsign <code>KF7ZKH</code> which didn&rsquo;t last long as I would request and receive the 1x3 vanity call of <code>K7JSX</code>.</p>
<p>Limited to primarily VHF/UHF and no mental bandwidth available to learn CW there was not much accomplished for about a decade after this but I did manage to recruit a few close friends to earn their Technician licenses.</p>
<p>Learn APRS? Check. <br>
Learn DMR?  Check. <br>
Amass an army of HTs? Check. <br>
Hear repeater drama and realize I didn&rsquo;t want to engage? Check!</p>
<p>As the time to renew my license neared in 2023 so did my desire to get on HF.
I had the time and attention span to make it happen but lacked the motivation.
Each year prior I was reminded of my slipping goals by the presence of ARRL Field Day reminder on my calendar.
This year was different, but I didn&rsquo;t know it yet.</p>
<p><code>KE7BUA</code>, a fellow ham I&rsquo;d met during Meshtastic experiments, informed me that getting an HF antenna on the air is easier then I expected.
All I needed was some wire, a transformer and some way to get the wire up in the air.
Ok, this is perfect. Let&rsquo;s get an end fed and see if I can get on 10 meters. Let&rsquo;s what the hype is about.
Shortly after tuning and deploying my first antenna I completed a QSO with <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/3G0YA">3G0YA</a> located on Easter Island.
Are you kidding me?! Contacting another hemisphere from my backyard with 5 watts, some wire and a fishing pole!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! I was hooked.</p>
<h3 id="general">General<a href="#general" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Study for General consisted of slamming flashcards on <a href="https://hamstudy.org/">hamstudy.org</a> for a few weeks and I obtained my General class license on <code>2024.06.01</code>, just in time for <strong>Field Day 2024</strong>.
I had achieved part of my goal. I learned <em>how</em> to do this. Now came the harder part. Do it <em>well</em>.
Three weeks was all I had to put together everything needed to participate.</p>
<p>Longer end-fed for 20m? I made my own. <br>
Create a kit for portable QRP ops? Done. <br>
Sunscreen? Oops&hellip;</p>
<p>It was time to, you know, go out in the field.
With long time friend and Technician license recruit <code>N7DEV</code> in tow I operated Field Day 2024 as <code>1B/QRP NV</code> and logged 36 QSOs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling it a win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great start to my General operating and I will one day make the final upgrade to Extra.
Until then, I&rsquo;ll continue experimenting and improving. I hope to see you on the air.</p>
